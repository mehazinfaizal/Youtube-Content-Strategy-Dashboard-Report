## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, NLTK)
- **YouTube Data API v3**
- **Power BI** (dashboards)
- **Jupyter Notebooks**

## Problem Tackled

- YouTube creators & brands struggle to understand what drives engagement (views, likes, comments) and how factors like posting time, video length, or title keywords affect performance.

- There is no straightforward dashboard that combines API-driven data collection, content analysis, and competitor benchmarking.
